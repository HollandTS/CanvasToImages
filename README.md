How it works: 
run main.py
Drag images onto the canvas, copy the full canvas (or save) to your clipboard by pressing [Copy}
Make edits with external tools (like with AI, photoshop, etc)
use [Paste] to Paste the image back onto the canvas as overlay, move in place (if view remained unmoved it might not be nessecary).
Press 'Apply Canvas to Images' to save all the individual images with the overlay

Tools usage:
- Right click drag to select multiple images in canvas
- Hold middle mouse button (scrollwheel) to pan around
- use [Select Bg Color] to pick temp transparency for images 
- Optional Snap and Grid: currently only have a 2D test grid 2 pxls, and TS and RA2 (c&c games) presets!
- Optional 'background color' to temporarily remove a background color that will be pasted back after execution. (for game tiles)
- Enable 'Full Layout' to copy/paste the canvas from outside view borders (so all images on canvas will be copied instead of just whats in current view)

  
Warning: Pressing 'Apply Canvas to Images' ALL IMAGES WILL BE SAVED IMMEDIATLY SO MAKE BACKUP OF IMAGES FIRST!

Real instructions coming soon...
Tool is currently very buggy but usable
